# This should have no bearing on the functionality of the code
# The only reason we have them
# is so we can have shebangs in our funk
# so funky scripts can be shell executable handiness
# But I just know they're going to be abused
# by some derpy fresh-out-of-college brogrammer
# who thinks that documenting the ever-loving snot out of his 
# overengineered cruft-buckets is a valid alternative to being 
# a good programmer
